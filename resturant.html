  <ul>     

   <li>          

  <strong>Caprese Salad</strong>

        <strong>Spinach Dip</strong>
    <p>Spinach is one of those ingredients that's packed with nutrients, vitamins, and minerals!</p> 
        </li>
    <li> <strong>Spinach Artichoke Dip</strong>
    <p>While beer cheese, Buffalo chicken, and queso will always have special places in our hearts, we keep coming back to good ol' spinach</p>
        </li>

   </ul>

<li>       <strong>Easy Bundt Pan Roasted Greek Chicken and Vegetables</strong>       
    <p>This easy Bundt pan roasted Greek chicken and vegetables gives incredible flavor to the potatoes, peppers, and carrots roasting below the whole, Greek-seasoned chicken, a whole new use for a Bundt pan</p>
</li>

<li>       <strong>Loaded Mac and Cheese</strong>       
    <p>I’ve been making a version of this basic mac and cheese for years, but I recently had the brilliant idea of upgrading my go-to recipe by incorporating crispy bacon along with onions that have been caramelized to perfection in the bacon fat.</p>
</li>

  <ul>     
   <li>

        <strong>Easy banana cake recipe</strong>
       <p>Every cook needs a moist banana cake recipe that they keep coming back to, and we think this recipe is the only one you need.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <strong>Pavlova</strong>
        <p>The age-old question, ‘who created the pavlova recipe?’ is one that causes tension between Australians and New Zealanders.</p>
